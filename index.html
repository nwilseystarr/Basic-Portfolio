                <blockquote>I am a Bootcamp student at Northwestern Coding Bootcamp focusing on the full-stack MERN
                    track. I have a degree in
                    Political Science from DePaul University, and am the Executive-Director for the Model United
                    Nations Development
                    Organization which aims to challenge future leaders to think from a global perspective through
                    immersive and experiential
                    education. I am also the Chief Operating Officer at cvVentures where we work with and invest in
                    startups and mature
                    businesses in the medical/biotech, fintech, education, and real estate sectors in Asia and
                    North America.

                    I have been “playing” with basic code since I was 14; however, through a project with
                    cvVentures I really started to see it as more than just an idea. It was while working on a new
                    fin-tech app in Hong Kong where I learned more about the ins and outs of programming. I am very 
                    excited to continue on my path of continued learning through Bootcamp and my career.
